# MyAttendance



MyAttendance is an Attendance List System which allows users to create student profiles, assign class IDâ€™s, create attendance lists, and enter additional student information as desired. This program was designed in Visual Studio using C# and made the use of SQL databases to store data such as student info and login password. The user will be able to create multiple attendance or class lists which can be saved to a local directory as a (.atd) file and can be opened at a later time to view all students in that class, as well as make any changes.

Enjoy!
